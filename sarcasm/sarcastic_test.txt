So heroiccccc
" 100% would recommend if you can't sleep"
Wow. Horrible suicide movie. No one died except the audience.
The Last Air-BANNED-der because who allowed such low quality movies to be produced???
Amazing portrayal of an abusive relationship (like how it's masked as acceptable when the guy is rich and attractive), 11/10 would recommend!!!
If I had nothing to do in life, you will find me watching the movie all day.
Bad neighbors is so hilarious
What's Christmas without a kinda-bad movie?
Well I guess everyone who lives will die in the end. 
Maybe should have asked one of the other sons to be in the movie
Wow, I would so subject myself to 2 more hours of this.
Best movie ever *rolls eyes* 
Brilliant on how they've managed to include zombies in a classic to make it more suitable for the younger generation who grew up with vampires and zombies
The mix of 'romance' and 'politics' in the movie can lift you off your seat (to exit the cinema) 
I love how its all about killing.
wow money and time well spent on watching them only trying to get out of the house. That's it guys yay she escaped. 
Disappointing 
I could have spent the money to print my notes instead.( Haha Idk!)
The movie was so good that I feel asleep
Best ending ever
The movie has touched me at all the wrong places
Will totally pay to watch Crappie again
It was awesome. 5 stars
The movie kept me on the edge of my seat so much that I nearly fell off.
